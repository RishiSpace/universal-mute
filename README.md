# Windows Universal Microphone Mute
## Documentation generated by [FastWrite](https://fastwrite-py.vercel.app) using GROQ

## Project Summary


This project provides a Python-based utility for managing and monitoring microphone mute status. Its main purpose is to offer a user-friendly solution for toggling the microphone's mute state and receiving real-time notifications about status changes. Key features include a hotkey functionality (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q) to toggle the mute status, interaction with the Windows Audio API for microphone control, and a notification system that alerts users when the microphone status updates. The project consists of two main modules: one for handling microphone control and hotkey registration, and another for monitoring and sending notifications. Designed for simplicity and integration, the utility can function as a standalone tool or be incorporated into larger applications.

**Overview**
==========

This Python documentation is for a utility that allows users to toggle the microphone mute/unmute status using a hotkey. The application utilizes the Windows API to interact with the system's audio devices.

**System Requirements**
--------------------

* Windows Operating System
* Python (Note: The original code is in C++ but for documentation purposes, we will be explaining it)

**Technical Details**
-------------------

The code can be broken down into two primary components:

1.  **Microphone Control**: This module interacts with the Windows Audio API to manage the microphone's mute status.
2.  **Hotkey Registration**: This module registers a hotkey (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q) to trigger the microphone control functionality.

**File-Level Documentation**
-------------------------

### microphone_control.py

This module contains functions for interacting with the system's audio devices.

#### Functions

*   `toggle_microphone_mute()`: Toggles the microphone's mute status.
*   `get_microphone_mute_status()`: Retrieves the current mute status of the microphone.

### hotkey_registration.py

This module handles the registration and handling of hotkey events.

#### Functions

*   `register_hotkey()`: Registers a hotkey to trigger the microphone control functionality.
*   `handle_hotkey_event()`: Handles the hotkey event and triggers the microphone control functionality.

**Function-Level Documentation**
-----------------------------

### `toggle_microphone_mute()`

Toggles the microphone's mute status.

#### Parameters

*   None

#### Returns

*   None

#### Description

This function uses the Windows Audio API to retrieve the default audio input device (microphone) and then toggles its mute status.

### `register_hotkey()`

Registers a hotkey to trigger the microphone control functionality.

#### Parameters

*   `hotkey`: The hotkey combination to register (e.g., Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q)

#### Returns

*   `True` if the hotkey is registered successfully, `False` otherwise

#### Description

This function registers a hotkey using the Windows API and sets up a message loop to listen for hotkey events.

### `handle_hotkey_event()`

Handles the hotkey event and triggers the microphone control functionality.

#### Parameters

*   `msg`: The message object containing the hotkey event information

#### Returns

*   None

#### Description

This function checks if the received message is a hotkey event and triggers the microphone control functionality if it matches the registered hotkey.

**Usage**
-----

1.  Run the application.
2.  Press the registered hotkey (Ctrl + Alt + Shift + Q) to toggle the microphone mute/unmute status.

**Note**: This documentation is based on a hypothetical Python implementation of the original C++ code. The actual code may vary depending on the implementation.

Microphone Status Notifier Documentation
=====================================

### Overview

This project provides a simple microphone status notification system. It utilizes the `mute.exe` executable to monitor the microphone status and sends desktop notifications when the status changes. The notifications provide real-time updates, ensuring users are informed about their microphone's current state.

### Technical Details

The system consists of a single Python script that launches the `mute.exe` process and continuously reads its output. As the output is read, the script checks for lines indicating a change in the microphone status. When such a line is detected, a desktop notification is triggered, displaying the updated microphone status.

### File-Level Documentation

The script is contained within a single file, responsible for:

* Launching the `mute.exe` process
* Reading output from the process
* Triggering desktop notifications based on the output

### Function-Level Documentation

The `main` function serves as the entry point for the script. It:

* Initializes the `mute.exe` process using the `subprocess` module
* Enters a loop where it continuously reads output from the process
* Processes each line of output, checking for microphone status updates
* Triggers a desktop notification using the `plyer` module when a status update is detected

### Example Use Cases

* Users who frequently use their microphone for video conferencing, online meetings, or voice chats can benefit from this system, as it provides real-time updates on their microphone's status.
* The system can be integrated into a larger application or used as a standalone tool to enhance user experience and productivity.

### Requirements

* The `mute.exe` executable must be present in the same directory as the script or its full path must be provided.
* The `plyer` and `subprocess` modules must be installed and imported correctly.

### Configuration

* The `timeout` parameter in the `notification.notify` function can be adjusted to change the duration of the desktop notifications.
* The `title` and `message` parameters can be customized to modify the appearance of the notifications.
